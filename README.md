# PhpMVC

Lightweight and simple framework that implements the MVC design pattern in PHP.

The code for the framework itself can be found at src/libs/Intentor.

*PhpMVC* uses [Addendum](https://github.com/eriknyk/addendum), [NotORM](https://github.com/vrana/notorm) and [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer).

Currently the project is **DISCONTINUED**. However, feel free to fork it and continue its development!
